FetchFox uses a [cost plus](/pricing) model, which means that we charge a fee on top of our AI and proxy costs. If you prefer, you can provide your own API keys for either or both of those. If you provide an API key for those services, billing for that service will be handled through your service provider.

## Use your own API key for AI

To use your own API key for AI, use the `ai` option in any request. You will need to specify two fields: `model` and `apiKey`.

Below is an example that uses your API key for OpenAI.

<ExtractAiApiKeyRequest />

This request will use the provided API key throughout the entire extraction process, and your AI usage billing will be handled by OpenAI.

Currently, we support three AI providers:

* **OpenAI** with model IDs prefixed with `openai:`
* **Google's Gemini** with model IDs prefixed with `gemini:`
* **OpenRouter** with model IDs prefixed with `openrouter:`

## Use your own API key for proxies

To use your own API key for AI, use the `proxy` option in any request. We support HTTP proxies and CDP proxies.

To use your own API key for proxies, set the `tier` field to `byok`, and pass in either HTTP or CDP proxy credentials.

To pass in HTTP proxy credentials, use the `server`, `username`, and `password` fields, like the example below.

<ExtractHttpRequest />

To pass in CDP proxy credentials, use the `cdp` field and set it to the connection endpoint, like the example below.

<ExtractCdpRequest />

In either of these cases, your network billing will be handled by your proxy provider.
