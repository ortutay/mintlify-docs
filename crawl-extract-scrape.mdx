There are two phases to scraping with FetchFox. First, you **crawl for URLs** that match a URL pattern. Then, you **extract data from the URLs** that matched your pattern.

Let's walk through an example, step-by-step.

## Crawl for URLs

You find URLs that match a pattern using the FetchFox's crawl endpoint. This endpoint has one required parameter, which `pattern`. This is a URL that may contain some \* characters in it, which act as wildcards. The crawl endpoint will find and return URLs that match that pattern.

Some examples of URL patterns:

- [**https://example.com**](https://example.com*)**\*** will match every URL starting with https://example.com
- [**https://example.com/\*/category/\***](https://example.com/*/category/*) will match URLs on [example.com](http://example.com) that have "/category/" in them.
- [**https://example.com/page-1**](https://example.com/page-1) has no wildcards, so it will match exactly one URL

The `pattern` field is the only required parameters for a crawl. Below is an example of how to call the crawl endpoint.

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl -X POST https://api.fetchfox.ai/api/crawl \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{"pattern":"https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/*"}'
```

</CodeGroup>

This call will take about a minute, and it finds all URLs starting with `https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/`, like `https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/pikachu`. The goal is to get the URLs of all the pokemon.

 The response will look something like this:

```
{
  "job_id": "5ooygvit1y",
  "results": {
    "hits": [
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all",
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/archaludon",
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/charizard",
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/corviknight",
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/dipplin",
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/dragapult",
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/dragonite",
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/eevee",
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/game/legends-arceus",
      "https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/game/scarlet-violet",
      ...more results..
    ]
  },
  "metrics": { ...cost and usage metrics ... }
}
```

This `.results.hits` section contains all the URLs matching the URL pattern `https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/*` .

You might have noticed a few unwanted URLs in the hits, like `https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/game/legends-arceus`. We can update our pattern to exclude this using the `:*` operator. This will match all characters _except_ for forward slash.

## Extract from URLs to get items
