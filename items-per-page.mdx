title: "Extracting "one" vs. "many" items per page"
description: "For any URL, you can extract either one item, or multliple items"

Most pages on the web fall into one of two categories:

- **Detail pages** that describe a single item
- **List pages** that show multiple items

FetchFox can extract from both pages. For detail pages, you want to extract one item for each URL, and for list pages, you want to extract multiple items per page.

The **default extraction mode** is to extract **one item per URL**. In this mode, if you pass in 10 URLs, you will get exactly 10 items in your results. This works well for detail pages.

To extract multiple items per page, simple set the `per_page` parameter to `many`. This will tell FetchFox that each URL you pass in contains many items.

Below is an example of passing in several URLs to the extract endpoint, and asking FetchFox to extract multliple items from each URL.
